mortgage_rates.py will send you an email everyday of the current mortgage rates listed on MortgageNewsDaily.com

You will need a email address to send from and receive to. The email address(es) should be stored as environment varibles on your system along with the password to the sending email address's account.

Varibles should be saved with the below names:
sender_email_address
email_password
receiver_email_address

This can be setup to run daily by scheduling a task to run the script everyday. You should pick a time after 4PM ET as that is when the rates are updated.
